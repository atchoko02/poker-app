vibe code


1. setup - all from user input
 - create range contructors x
 - create a flop x
 - input bet and raise amounts

 - 
 
    Structure:
        - Each node will be kept track of as game states

        - each ndoe will have to know their current frequencies, and be able to recalculate a new stratagy
            - so we need to keep track of the EV's of each of out children, and use this with the probability if each child to caculate our current stratagy EV
            - Then from this we can calculate regret of each child, and from the regret of each child we are able to cacluate out new stratagy
        
        Terminal Nodes:
            - terminal nodes will have to know their values by keeping track of how much has been contributed, and the winnings.
            - FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE VALUES FOR EACH HAND

        What each node needs to know:
            - how much they (IP/OOP) have contributed
            - total pot size
            - whether or not they are IP or OOP
            - a way to map each action to its frequencies and EVs
        
        Contants:
            - community cards
            - probability of each hand in the range

    
2. build tree
 - be able to build correct decision tree based amounts
    (no caculations needed yet)

3. caculation
 - use leaf nodes to calculate evs - can use the treys evaluator
 - use evs to cacluate regret
